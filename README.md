# LED Matrix Companion App
##### This is a companion app for My Arduino powered LED Matrix
##### For more information and how to build this project please got to: 

## Usage 

1. Connect your phone to the Hotspot created by the LED Matrix. The default password is: 12345678
2. Write your Text in the Text field. Hit the send Button and it should now appear on the Matrix.
3. You can also change the brightness from the App. 

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure that you are connected to the Hotspot. Android sometimes disconnects by itself, because the LED Matrix doesn't provide a internet connection.
- Press the button on the backside of the case. It should now display its IP Adress. Make sure that in the settings of the App the IP Adress is the same. The Port shoud 
  remain Port 10002.
